Why Do You Need a Mississippi Title?
 
A title is a legal document that proves your ownership of a vehicle. It contains important information about the vehicle, such as the VIN, the make and model, the odometer reading, and any liens or encumbrances on it. A title is required for the following purposes:

- To register your vehicle and obtain a license plate.
- To sell or transfer your vehicle to another person or entity.
- To apply for a loan or insurance for your vehicle.
- To report a stolen or recovered vehicle.

If you lose or damage your title, you can apply for a replacement title using Form 78-006. If you change your name or address, you can apply for a corrected title using Form 78-007. If you move to another state, you will need to surrender your Mississippi title and obtain a new one from the new state.
