## More About Rings (2017) Movie
 
Rings (2017) is directed by F. Javier GutiÃ©rrez and written by David Loucka, Jacob Aaron Estes, and Akiva Goldsman. It stars Matilda Lutz, Alex Roe, Johnny Galecki, Vincent D'Onofrio, Aimee Teegarden, and Bonnie Morgan. It is the third installment in the American Ring franchise, which is based on the Japanese novel and film series Ring by Koji Suzuki.
 
The movie was released on February 3, 2017, by Paramount Pictures. It received mostly negative reviews from critics and audiences, who criticized its plot, characters, acting, and lack of originality. It grossed $83 million worldwide against a budget of $25 million.
 
The movie follows Julia (Lutz), a college student who becomes worried about her boyfriend Holt (Roe) when he stops contacting her. She learns that he is involved in a research project led by Professor Gabriel (Galecki), who has discovered a mysterious videotape that kills the viewer seven days after watching it. Julia decides to watch the tape herself to save Holt and discovers a hidden movie within the movie that reveals the origin of the curse. She and Holt embark on a quest to find out the truth about Samara (Morgan), the vengeful ghost behind the tape.
 
The movie explores themes such as death, fate, guilt, obsession, and technology. It also references elements from the previous movies, such as the well, the horse, the fly, and the ring. It also introduces new concepts, such as the Braille markings on Samara's coffin and the cicada symbolism.
 
Rings (2017) is a movie that tries to revive a classic horror franchise but fails to deliver anything new or scary. It is a disappointing sequel that does not live up to the expectations of the fans of The Ring (2002) and The Ring Two (2005). However, if you are curious about how the story of Samara continues, you can watch it in HD online for free using an HD online player.
